- Need tests for:
    -  Passing of -Keep (including "raw")
    -  Passing of -Name
    -  Handling of extra_args

- Check arguments; RE should not accept paramaters not mentioned in -config.

- Write documentation

- Write document explaining why Regexp::Common510 in stead of Regexp::Common
 (part of README?)
